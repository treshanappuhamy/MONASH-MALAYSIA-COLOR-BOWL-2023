# MONASH-MALAYSIA-COLOR-BOWL-2023

The objective of the competition is to engineer a self-sufficient (autonomous) robot that can detect and move coloured pucks, utilizing them to displace bowling pins by a flicking mechanism, all determined by the specified color signals given (level 1 and level 2) or by detecting the position of the bowling pins placed in their respective zone (level 3 and level 4). This operation must take place within a designated playing field. The challenges involve not just the technicalities of puck detection and movement but also the precise execution of the flicking action to ensure the bowling pins are successfully knocked down.

I was in charge of designing the base structure and the mechanical aspects of the robot. I also evaluate the structural integrity of the robot when the circuits are connected and the firmware is used to control the robot. I was fully responsible for designing SOLIDWORKS drawings to model the robot and facilitate the 3D printing services provided by the university. Together with my teammate Jin Chun, I integrate the mechanical and electrical subsystems of the robot with the firmware to ensure the robotâ€™s structural integrity is maintained.
